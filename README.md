OnTask Version 1.0 10/23/2021

OnTask is a project management application I created to familiarize myself with object-oriented programming. Notable features include a "productivity tips" section, as well as a theme chooser.  Users also have the ability to choose between a card view and a compact display.

The application uses localStorage to store metadata associated with projects, as well as their respective tasks. Data related to the user's chosen theme is stored as well. OnTask also makes use of date-fns, a JavaScript date utility library, in order to display reminders based on a given taskâ€™s deadline.
